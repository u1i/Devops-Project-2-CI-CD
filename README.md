Lets learn about Boxing


## This is a page for to learn boxing, showcasing different styles used in boxing for both defence and offence.

I have been procastinating doing this project by watching videos of boxing, hence will take the time to combine both the project and a hobby of mine to keep fit.

Here I will share different videos that I find useful to showcase some of the popular boxers that can display gret technique and style.

There is always a need for basics before trying out more advance technique and styles that professional boxers use,

From this website, I hope more people would pick up this hobby to keep their body fit and healthy and also improve their coordination.

I will try to hand pick the videos that I find most valuable to watch, with some videos being in slow motion for the viewer to pick up the technique better.

Lets Enjoy
